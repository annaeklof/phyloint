#' Sample food-web dataset with which to study phylogenetic intervality
#'
#' The object 'eklof' has two items: a 'network' object and a 'tree' object.
#' The 'network' object is a binary SxS matrix where a value of 1 indicates
#' that the row species consumes the column species. The 'tree' object is a
#' phylogenetic tree of class 'phylo' (see 'ape::read.tree'). The data are a
#' synthetic dataset created to demonstrate how to use the 'phyloint' package
#' and therefore do not have an associated reference.
